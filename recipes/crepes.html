    <h2>About this dish</h2>
        <p>Crepes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
